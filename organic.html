           <h1>ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING</h1>
           <p>
            <h3>1. Municipal solid wastes</h3>
            <p>Municipal solid wastes include the more common wastes that are generated in our daily life in the form of product packaging, grass clippings, furniture, clothing, bottles, food scraps, appliances, paint, newspapers, and batteries.
                These wastes are generated from residential areas, schools, hospitals, and businesses.
                </p>
            
           <h3> 2. Cattle wastes</h3>
            <p>Cattle wastes are animal wastes that are of animal origin and act as good resources of organic matter.
                Cattle waste is also an important soil fertilizer that provides a high concentration of micro and macronutrients for crop growth and soil fertility.
                Cattle manure and fodder constitute organic wastes in the form of cattle wastes. Besides, poultry wastes and piggery wastes also add the number of organic wastes from animal origin.
                </p>

            <h3>3. Food wastes</h3>
            <p>Food wastes account for about 30% of total organic waste in nature via natural and artificial means.
                Some of the examples of food wastes include peelings, cores, leaves, fruits, twigs, outer skins, and sludges.
                Fruit and vegetable canning industries, frozen vegetable industries, and fruit drying industries, along with residential areas and hotels or restaurants are the major producers of food wastes.
